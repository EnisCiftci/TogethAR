# Introduction 
TogethAR started as a Study-Project which aimed at creating an Alternative Reality iPad App with collaborative tools and sessions. The objective is to enable users to host and participate in sessions, showcasing 3D models to other participants.

# Sessions
To facilitate seamless sessions, users can host their own rooms or join existing ones created by other users within proximity. The user has complete control over the room, deciding whether it should be open to all or password-protected, instant or queued, and specifying the maximum number of participants, up to 8 users.

# Collaborative Tools
To allow for the showcase of 3D models, users can place them on any horizontal plane within the room. Users can then move, edit, zoom, turn, and delete their models. Any changes made by a user are synchronized across all participants in the session. Each object has its own "Master". By long-pressing on a object users can identify whom the object belongs to or if they are the master, edit it.

The app has several collaborative tools, such as the laser pointer, which projects a dot from the center of the screen onto the real world or AR object. Users can adjust the pointer's size as per their preference. Drawing tools like "AirDraw" allow users to draw shapes in the air on a plane parallel to the screen, which can be pushed up to 2m away or pulled up to 10cm in front of the screen. Another drawing tool "Projection" projects the drawing onto the real world or AR objects. The colors of the laser pointer, drawing lines, and user model are randomly assigned at session entry.

# UX
The app has an intuitive interface, with swipe gestures allowing users to use the app naturally. For instance, a swipe left or right opens the model picker, while swiping down on the rooms menu closes it. The toolbar can be moved and snapped to enable left or right-handed mode.

# Future 

There are plans to expand the functionality of TogethAR in the future with several new features. These include the development of an iPhone port and an upgraded drawing tool with PencilKit, among many others.
