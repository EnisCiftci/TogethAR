# Introduction 
TogethAR started as a Study-Project. The Idea was to create an Alternative Reality iPad App with collaborative Tools and Sessions. Users will be able to host sessions and showcase 3D Models to other participants.

# Sessions
Users will be able to host their own Room or join Rooms created by other users in the vicinity. The user can decide whether the Room should be open to join or require a password, be able to join instantly or be put into a queue, or how many participants can join a room up to 8 Users max.

# Collaborative Tools
To allow Users to showcase 3D Models they can place the 3D Object on a horizontal plane inside the Room. They can move, edit, zoom, turn and delete their Models and all changes are synchronized across all participants in the Session. Every Object has its own "Master" and Users can identify which Object belongs to who by long pressing on a Object, or they can edit the Object if its their Object. 

Other Tools are:

->Laserpointer which projects a dot from the center of the screen to either the real world or a AR-Object. The Pointer size can be adjusted to be smaller or bigger to the Users liking.

->Drawing Tools are "AirDraw" which allows the user to draw shapes in the air on a plane horizontal to the screen. The plane can be pushed up to 2m away or pulled up to 10cm infront of the screen.

->Another drawing Tool is "Projection" which projects the drawing onto the real world or AR-Objects.

The colors of the Laserpointer, drawing lines and User Model are asigned randomly at Session Entry

# UX
Intuitive swipe gestuers allows the User to use the App in a natural feeling way. Swipe Gestures include "Swipe Left/Right" to open the ModelPicker, "Swipe Down" on the Rooms Menu to close it, "Move and Snap" the Toolbar to enable left- or righthanded Mode.

# Future 
I plan to expand this App in the future with many features. For example I plan to expand the App with an iPhone port or to upgrade the drawing Tools with PencilKit
